# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Example using USPS dataset

* In notebook `CNN.ipynb`, I showed how image classification can be performed using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

* Here an example of _**CNN**_ has been illustrated using a dataset called _**USPS**_, which is a dataset of handwritten digit images with the spatial dimension of `16 x 16` pixels.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Portion of training dataset`, `Portion of test dataset`, `Loss and accuracy curve.pdf` and `Model prediction.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `CNN.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `CNN.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
