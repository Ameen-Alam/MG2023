# Classify `SVHN images` using pretrained `VGG16` with PyTorch

* In notebook `VGG16.ipynb`, I showed how image classification can be performed using a pretrained **VGG16** architecture.

* Here an example of _**VGG16**_ has been illustrated using a dataset called _**SVHN**_, which is a dataset that contains 73257 digits for training and 26032 digits for testing with the spatial dimension of `32 x 32` pixels.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Portion of training dataset.pdf`, `Portion of test dataset.pdf`, `Loss and accuracy curve.pdf` and `Model prediction.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `AlexNet.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `AlexNet.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
