# Internal Cluster Validation: `Hartigan` index

* In notebook `Hartigan.ipynb`, I showed how `internal cluster validation` can be performed using **Hartigan index**.

* A higher value of __Hartigan__ index indicates better clustering result.

* I used `river` module version _0.7.0_, which is a old version. The latest version of river module doesn't have any method to calculate __Hartigan__ index. Moreover, I didn't find a way to calculate __Hartigan__ index using `river` module version _0.7.0_ without using the centroids of clusters.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `Hartigan.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
