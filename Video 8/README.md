# Save multiple plots in one figure using Matplotlib

* In notebook `Matplotlib.ipynb`, I showed how multiple plots can be saved in one figure using **Matplotlib**.

* Here an example has been shown using a dataset called _**MNIST**_, which is a dataset of handwritten digit images with the spatial dimension of `28 x 28` pixels.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Training_images.pdf` and `testing_images.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `Matplotlib.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `Matplotlib.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
