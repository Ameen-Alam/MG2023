# `OpenSlide` for Whole-Slide Image (WSI) Processing

* In notebook `OpenSlide_WSI.ipynb`, I showed how Whole-Slide Image (WSI) can be processed using **OpenSlide** library.

* Here an example has been shown using a _**WSI**_ with __`.svs`__ format; this WSI was created using an `Aperio` scanner.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `WSI.pdf`, which shows the WSI that I used in `OpenSlide_WSI.ipynb` in `.pdf` format for observation purpose only.

> Unfortunately, I could not upload the __`WSI.svs`__ file in GitHub because it has a size of `107 MB` and it is over the limit of GitHub's requirements.

>> But, you can download a random WSI with __`.svs`__ format by following the instructions described in this link: [Andrew Janowczyk](http://www.andrewjanowczyk.com/download-tcga-digital-pathology-images-ffpe/)
