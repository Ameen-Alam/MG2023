# `Hierarchical` clustering - Example using `wine` dataset

* In notebook `Hierarchical_Clustering.ipynb`, I showed how __hierarchical__ clustering can be performed using **scikit-learn**.

* Here an example of _**hierarchical**_ clustering has been shown using _sklearn's_ `wine` dataset. This is a dataset that contains 3 types of wines: `class_0`, `class_1` and `class_2`. It has 178 samples and 13 features.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Dendrogram (unscaled).pdf`, `Dendrogram (scaled)` and `Confusion matrix.pdf`, which are a few images you will see in `Hierarchical_Clustering.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `Hierarchical_Clustering.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
