# `Strings` in Python

* In notebook `STRING.ipynb`, I showed how different operations can be performed in Python programming language using **strings**.

* Using `strings`, I have shown the following operations

<ol>
<li> Iterate through the string using for loop </li>
<li> string indexing and slicing </li>
<li> Iterate through the string using while loop </li>
<li> Check item in string </li>
<li> if-else statement with string </li>
<li> Print string in reverse order </li>
<li> Remove empty space from the middle of a string </li>
<li> string concatenation </li>
<li> Different string operations </li>
</ol>

* These are some of the basic operations that can be performed using `strings` in Python.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `STRING.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
