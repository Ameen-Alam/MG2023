# Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Using L1 and L2 Regularization - Example with `FashionMNIST` dataset

* In notebook `CNN_L1_L2_Regularization.ipynb`, I showed how image classification can be performed using CNN and how a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** can be trained using `L1` and `L2` regularization.

* Here an example of _**CNN_L1_L2_Regularization**_ has been illustrated using a dataset called _**FashionMNIST**_, which is a dataset of grayscale images with the spatial dimension of `28 x 28` pixels. It has 60000 `training images` and 10000 `test images`.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Portion of training dataset`, `Portion of test dataset`, `Loss and accuracy curve.pdf`, `Model prediction.pdf`, `Loss and accuracy curve considering L1 regularization.pdf`, `Model prediction considering L1 regularization.pdf`, `Loss and accuracy curve considering L2 regularization.pdf` and `Model prediction considering L2 regularization.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `CNN_L1_L2_Regularization.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `CNN_L1_L2_Regularization.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
