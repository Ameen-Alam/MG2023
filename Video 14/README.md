# Rand Index (`RI`) and Adjusted Rand Index (`ARI`) - Example using `iris` dataset

* In notebook `RI_ARI.ipynb`, I showed how `external cluster cluster validation` can be performed using **Rand Index (RI) and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**.

* Here an example of _**RI_ARI**_ has been shown using _sklearn's_ `iris` dataset. This is a dataset that contains 3 types of flowers: `setosa`, `versicolor` and `virginica`. It has 150 samples and 4 features.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Confusion matrix.pdf` which is an image you will see in `RI_ARI.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `RI_ARI.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
