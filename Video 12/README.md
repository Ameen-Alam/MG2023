# `Tuples` in Python

* In notebook `TUPLE.ipynb`, I showed how different operations can be performed in Python programming language using **tuples**.

* Using _tuples_, I have shown the following operations

<ol>
<li> Iterate through the tuple using for loop </li>
<li> Iterate through the tuple using while loop </li>
<li> Create a tuple using tuple() function </li>
<li> Create an empty tuple </li>
<li> Create a one element tuple </li>
<li> Access elements within a tuple </li>
<li> Add elements to a tuple </li>
<li> Concatenate tuples </li>
<li> Repeat the elements within a tuple </li>
<li> Count the frequency of an element using count() method </li>
<li> Find the position of an element using index() method </li>
<li> Nested tuples </li>
</ol>

* These are some of the basic operations that can be performed using _**tuples**_ in Python.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `TUPLE.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
