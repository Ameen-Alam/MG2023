# `AdaBoost Classifier` using Scikit-Learn

`AdaBoost Classifier` is a supervised machine learning algorithm. AdaBoost is the short for __Adaptive Boosting__, which is used as an ensemble method in machine learning. In this model, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled using a logistic function.

I used `dry_bean.xlsx` dataset for this example. The dataset is available in the repository. It contains 7 types of beans: __SEKER, BARBUNYA, BOMBAY, CALI, HOROZ, SIRA & DERMASON__.
