# `Spectral` clustering - Example using `iris` dataset

* In notebook `Spectral_Clustering.ipynb`, I showed how __spectral__ clustering can be performed using **scikit-learn**.

* Here an example of _**spectral**_ clustering has been shown using _sklearn's_ `iris` dataset. This is a dataset that contains 3 types of flowers: `setosa`, `versicolor` and `virginica`. It has 150 samples and 4 features.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Confusion matrix.pdf` which is an image you will see in `Spectral_Clustering.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `RI_ARI.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
