# `Bernoulli Naive Bayes` using Scikit-Learn

`Bernoulli Naive Bayes` is a supervised machine learning algorithm which has been used for a classification task in this example. It is suitable for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification). It normally requires integer feature counts but, fractional counts may also work in practice.
