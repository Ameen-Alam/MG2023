# `Eigengap heuristic method` to determine the optimal number of clusters

* In notebook `Eigengap_Heuristic.ipynb`, I showed how __Eigengap heuristic method__ can be used to determine the optimal number of clusters in a certain dataset. I used **Scikit-Learn** to create some artificial data.

* This example has been shown using _sklearn's_ `blobs` dataset.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Ground truth and spectral clustering plot.pdf` and `Eigengap plot.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `Eigengap_Heuristic.ipynb`.
