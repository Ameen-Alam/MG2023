# Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (`Cond_VAE`) - Example using `MNIST` dataset

Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (`Cond_VAE`) is a generative model which assumes that the data is generated by some random process, involving unobserved continuous random variables. Like any other AutoEncoder, it has an `encoder` and a `decoder`.

The __encoder__ tries to learn q(z|x, y) which is the same as learning the hidden representation of the data x, conditioned on y (in this case, the labels of `MNIST` images). The __decoder__ on the other hand tries to learn p(x|z, y) which is just decoding the hidden representation to input space conditioned by y.
