# Internal Cluster Validation: `Silhouette` score, `Davies-Bouldin (DB)` score, `Calinski-Harabasz (CH)` score 

* In notebook `SDBCH.ipynb`, I showed how `internal cluster validation` can be performed using **Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin (DB) score and `Calinski-Harabasz (CH)` score**.

* Cluster validation techniques are used for determining the _goodness_ of a clustering algorithm.

* In the case of __DI__,  the higher the value, the better is the clustering result.

* __DI__ is calculated by taking the ratio of the lowest inter-cluster distance and the largest intra-cluster distance from the number of clusters within the data.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `DI.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
