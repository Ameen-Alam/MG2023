# `statistics` Module in Python

* In notebook `STATISTICS.ipynb`, I showed how some basic statistical computations like _mean_, _median_, _mode_, _standard deviation_ and _variance_ can be performed using Python's built-in **statistics** module.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `STATISTICS.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
