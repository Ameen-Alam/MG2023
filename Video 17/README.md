# Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (`UMAP`)

* In notebook `UMAP.ipynb`, I showed how `dimension reduction` can be performed using **UMAP**.

* Here an example of _**UMAP**_ has been shown using _sklearn's_ `digits` dataset. This is a dataset that contains 10 different digits. It has 1797 samples and 64 features.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `2D UMAP.pdf` and `3D UMAP.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `UMAP.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `UMAP.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
