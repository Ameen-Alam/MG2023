# String Formatting in Python

* In notebook `String_Formatting.ipynb`, I showed 3 types of string formatting (**the `%` operator, the `format` method and the `f-string`**) using Python programming language.

* Using `list comprehension`, I have shown the following operations

* These are some of the frequently used `string formatting` in Python.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `String_Formatting.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
