# Different uses of `for` loop in Python programming language

* In notebook `FOR_LOOP.ipynb`, I showed how different operations can be performed in Python programming language using **for loops**.

* Using `for` loops, I have shown the following operations

<ol>
<li> Iterate through a string </li>
<li> Iterate through a list </li>
<li> Iterate through a tuple </li>
<li> Iterate through a dictionary </li>
<li> Iterate through a set </li>
<li> for loop and range function </li>
<li> break and continue statements within for loop </li>
<li> if-else sttements within for loop </li>
<li> Nested for loops </li>
<li> for loop and zip function </li>
</ol>

* These are some of the basic operations that can be performed using `for` loops in Python.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `FOR_LOOP.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
