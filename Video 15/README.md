# Mutual Information (`MI`), Adjusted Mutual Information (`AMI`) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) - Example using `winr` dataset

* In notebook `MI_AMI_NMI.ipynb`, I showed how `external cluster validation` can be performed using **Mutual Information (MI) and Adjusted Mutual Information (ARI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)**.

* Here an example of _**MI, AMI and NMI**_ has been shown using _sklearn's_ `wine` dataset. This is a dataset that contains 3 types of wines: `class_0`, `class_1` and `class_2`. It has 178 samples and 13 features. I dropped a few features from the dataset in this example.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Confusion matrix.pdf` which is an image you will see in `MI_AMI_NMI.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `MI_AMI_NMI.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
