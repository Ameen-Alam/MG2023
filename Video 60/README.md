# `Decision Tree` using Scikit-Learn

`Decision Tree` is a supervised machine learning algorithm which has been used for a classification task in this example. It is a tree-like model of decisions and and their possible consequences. It is a type of machine learning algorithm that make predictions based on how a previous set of questions were answered.

I used `wheat_seed.csv` dataset for this example. The dataset is available in the repository. This dataset contains three varieties of wheat seed: __Kama, Rosa & Canadian__.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

I obtained this tree using `max_depth=3`:

This is the plot of __feature importance__:
