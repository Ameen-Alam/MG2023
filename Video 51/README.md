# Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (`Cond_VAE`) - Example using `MNIST` dataset

Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (`Cond_VAE`) is a generative model which assumes that the data is generated by some random process, involving unobserved continuous random variables. Like any other AutoEncoder, it has an `encoder` and a `decoder`.

The __encoder__ tries to learn $q(z|x)$
