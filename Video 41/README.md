# `Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)` for clustering - calculate `AIC/BIC`

* In notebook `GMM.ipynb`, I tried to implement __Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)__ for clustering using **Scikit-Learn**.

* Here, I also provided the `penguins.csv` file which is the dataset that I used in this example.

* Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) assume that a certain number of Gaussian distributions exist within a dataset. Therefore, each Gaussian distribution represents a particular cluster.

* We can also calculate `AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)` and `BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)` in **GMM** clustering to determine the best fit. 
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Confusion matrix.pdf` and `Plot of best fit.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `GMM.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `GMM.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
