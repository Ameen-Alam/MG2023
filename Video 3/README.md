# Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) - Example using USPS dataset

* In notebook `VAE.ipynb`, I showed how image reconstruction can be performed using a **Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)**. Like AutoEncoders, _VAEs_ are also generative models and they are capable of creating nice samples from noise vectors (if trained well).

* Here an example of _**VAE**_ has been illustrated using a dataset called _**USPS**_, which is a dataset of handwritten digit images with the spatial dimension of `16 x 16` pixels.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Portion of train dataset.pdf`, `Portion of test dataset.pdf`, `Loss curve.pdf`, `Model prediction.pdf` and `Generated images from noise vectors.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `VAE.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `VAE.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
