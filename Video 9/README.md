# Different uses of `while` loop in Python programming language

* In notebook `WHILE_LOOP.ipynb`, I showed how different operations can be performed in Python programming language using **while loops**.

* Using `while` loops, I have shown the following operations

<ol>
<li> Simplest while loop </li>
<li> Print a message till the condition remains True </li>
<li> break and continue statements within while loop </li>
<li> else sttement with while loop </li>
<li> while loop and list </li>
<li> while loop through a string </li>
<li> Iterate through a dictionary using while loop </li>
<li> Iterate through a tuple using while loop </li>
<li> Iterate through a set using while loop </li>
<li> Nested while loops </li>
<li> while loop and range function </li>
</ol>

* These are some of the basic operations that can be performed using `while` loops in Python.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `WHILE_LOOP.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
