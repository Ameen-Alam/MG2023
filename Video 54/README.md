# `Conditional DDPM` using PyTorch - Example with `MNIST` dataset

In this video, `MNIST` dataset images have been used to train a *Conditional_DDPM* along with their labels to conditionally generate the output. `MNIST` dataset has 10 classes: __One - 1, Two - 2, Three - 3, Four - 4, Five - 5, Six - 6, Seven - 7, Eight - 8, Nine - 9, Ten - 10__. Here is a portion of these samples:
