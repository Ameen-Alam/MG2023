# Image manipulation using `PIL` (Python Imaging Library)

* In notebook `PIL.ipynb`, I showed how image manipulation can be performed using **Python Imaging Library (PIL)**.
 
* Apart from the code, I also provided the images used for demonstrating this example: `SQUID.JPG` and `FISH.JPG`.

> Unfortunately, I could not save and upload the __`PIL.ipynb`__ with all the outputs shown in it because the file size became `60 MB` when I did that and it is over the limit of GitHub's requirements.

>> The maximum size for a file to be uploaded in GitHub has to be within __25 MB__.
