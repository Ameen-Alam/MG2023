# `DBSCAN` clustering (using `Scikit-Learn`)

* In notebook `DBSCAN_Clustering.ipynb`, I showed how __DBSCAN__ clustering can be performed using **Scikit-Learn**.

* Here an example of _**DBSCAN**_ clustering has been shown using _sklearn's_ `moons` dataset.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Data partition.pdf`, `DBSCAN clustering results (case 1).pdf` and `DBSCAN clustering results (case 2).pdf` which are a few images you will see in `DBSCAN_Clustering.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `DBSACN_Clustering.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
