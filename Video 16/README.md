# Homogeneity Score (`HS`), Completeness Score (`CS`), V-Measure Score (`VMS`) and Fowlkes-Mallows Score (`FMS`) - Example using `breast_cancer` dataset

* In notebook `HS_CS_VMS_FMS.ipynb`, I showed how `external cluster validation` can be performed using **Homogeneity Score (HS), Completeness Score (CS), V-Measure Score (VMS) and Fowlkes-Mallows Score (FMS)**.

* Here an example of _**HS, CS, VMS and FMS**_ has been shown using _sklearn's_ `breast_cancer` dataset. This is a dataset that contains 2 types of cancer (_breast_): `malignat (0)` and `benign (1)`. It has 569 samples and 30 features.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Confusion matrix.pdf` which is an image you will see in `HS_CS_VMS_FMS.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `HS_CS_VMS_FMS.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
