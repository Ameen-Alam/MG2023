# Classify CIFAR10 images using pretrained `AlexNet` with PyTorch

* In notebook `AlexNet.ipynb`, I showed how image classification can be performed using a pretrained **AlexNet** architecture.

* Here an example of _**AlexNet**_ has been illustrated using a dataset called _**CIFAR10**_, which is a dataset that contains 60000 color images in 10 different classe with the spatial dimension of `16 x 16` pixels.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Portion of training dataset.pdf`, `Portion of test dataset.pdf`, `Loss and accuracy curve.pdf` and `Model prediction.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `CNN.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `AlexNet.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
