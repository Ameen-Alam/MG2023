# List Comprehension in Python

* In notebook `List_Comprehension.ipynb`, I showed how different operations can be performed in Python programming language using **list comprehension**.

* Using `list comprehension`, I have shown the following operations

<ol>
<li> Iterate through the elements using list comprehension </li>
<li> if statement within list comprehension </li>
<li> if-else statement within list comprehension </li>
<li> range function within list comprehension </li>
<li> Iterate through a string using list comprehension </li>
<li> Reverse string using list comprehension </li>
<li> Nested if statements within list comprehension </li>
<li> Nested list comprehension </li>
</ol>

* These are some of the basic operations that can be performed using `list comprehension` in Python.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `List_Comprehension.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
