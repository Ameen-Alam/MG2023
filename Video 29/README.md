# `math` Module in Python

* In notebook `MATH.ipynb`, I showed how several mathematical tasks can be performed using a set of methods and constants available in Python's built-in **math** module.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `MATH.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__..
