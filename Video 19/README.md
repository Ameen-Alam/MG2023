# Principal Component Analysis (`PCA`)

* In notebook `PCA.ipynb`, I showed how `dimension reduction` can be performed using **PCA**.

* Here an example of _**PCA**_ has been shown using _sklearn's_ `breast cancer` dataset. This is a dataset that contains 2 types of breast cancer. It has 569 samples and 30 features.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `2D PCA.pdf` and `3D PCA.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `PCA.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `PCA.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
