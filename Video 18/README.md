# t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (`t-SNE`)

* In notebook `t_SNE.ipynb`, I showed how `dimension reduction` can be performed using **t-SNE**.

* Here an example of _**t-SNE**_ has been shown using _sklearn's_ `wine` dataset. This is a dataset that contains 3 types of wines. It has 178 samples and 13 features.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `2D t-SNE.pdf` and `3D t-SNE.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `t_SNE.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `t_SNE.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
