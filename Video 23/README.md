# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - Example using USPS dataset

* In notebook `ANN.ipynb`, I showed how image classification can be performed using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.

* Here an example of _**ANN**_ has been illustrated using a dataset called _**USPS**_, which is a dataset of handwritten digit images with the spatial dimension of 16 x 16 pixels.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Loss and accuracy curve.pdf` and `Model prediction.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `ANN.ipynb`

> Some differences can be found with notebook `ANN.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
