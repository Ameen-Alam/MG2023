# Create patches from a big image both `sequentially` and `randomly`

* In notebook `Create_Patches.ipynb`, I showed how patches (small portions) can be created both `sequentially` and `randomly` using **Python** programming language.
 
* Apart from the code, I also provided the image used for demonstrating this example: `SQUID.JPG`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `Create_Patches.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
