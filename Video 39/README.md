# `BIRCH` clustering - Example using `titanic` dataset

* In notebook `BIRCH_Clustering.ipynb`, I showed how __BIRCH__ clustering can be performed using **titanic** dataset.

* Here, I also provided the `titanic.csv` file which is the dataset that I used in this example.
 
* Apart from the code, I added `Confusion matrix.pdf` and `Survived.pdf` which are a few images you will see in `BIRCH_Clustering.ipynb`.

> Some differences can be found with notebook `BIRCH_Clustering.ipynb` and the code that has been shown in the video of __MEDIOCRE_GUY__ YouTube channel.

These are minor differences. __NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT__.
